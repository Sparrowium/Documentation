Associate Design

<h2 style="color:#6290C3"><center> Network Design Fundamentals </center></h2>
## The Architect/Designer Role

- Assess the customer's current environments and its ability to satisfy their current business and technology requirements.
	
- Identify the technology shortfalls that need to be addresses.
	
- Develop a core technology roadmap that will achieve the customer's required endgame environment.
	
- Evaluate what is necessary for migrating successfully from one environment to another.
	
- Create high-level architectural designs and low-level detailed designs of network devices, configurations, and interconnections.
## Doing the Research

- Research about the customer:
	
	- The business and industry the customer is in.
		
	- What sets the customer apart from competitors.
		
	- What network design will meet their approval.
		
	- Business requirements and goals, state of the current network environment, analyze current and future network behavior.
	
- Engaging with the customer;
	
	- Recognizing and understand their management hierarchy.
		
	- Identify who makes the decisions. Work closely with the customer to learn their overall goal.
		
	- Understand the criteria or a successful design. Know where the risks are and consequences for failure.
	
- **Expect some Back-and-Forth.**
## Creating a Network Design

- [Juniper Network's Lifecycle Service]: Consist of three main phases and it's often cyclical throughout the design's lifetime.

	- [Planning Phase]: Assess the current environment and determine if it can satisfy the requirements proposed by the consumer. After evaluating the current setup, it will then move on to designing high-level architectural plans as well as low-level details of devices, configuration, and interconnection.
		
	- [Build Phase]: Deploying both test and production environments. Migrate from the existing environment to a new one, taking care of installations, configuration, system testing, and system enablement.
		
	- [Operate Phase]: Supporting the customer by making sure we have the most effective use of the solution and will provide assistance for any issues and faults, and carry out proactive maintenance. Optimize over time.
	
- [Plan Methodology: Data Analysis]: The design or plan phase of the service life cycle. Consist of two key subphases.

	- [Assess Sub-phase]: Evaluate the current environment and its ability to meet the customer business and technological needs. 
		
		- Identify technology gaps that need addressing and develop a core technology roadmap to achieve the customers desired in game environment. Determine what's necessary for successful migration from one environment to another. 
			
		- Define a scope of design projects, which could range from a small network segment to an entire network, also determine if it's a simple upgrade or an entirely new network.
			
		- Conduct a Data Analysis to assess the current networks condition and also identify improvements based on customer requirements and the project scope. Examine how the business drives data usage on the networks and the number of users accessing the network both internally and externally.
		
	- [Design Sub-phase]: Create high-level architectural plans and detailed plans for network devices, configurations, and connections.
		
		- Develop a project plan, outlining responsibilities, timelines, and dependencies.
			
		- Work on the high-level design, which is usually a logical topology that identifies protocols used, network addressing, security, and naming conventions.
			
		- Focus on the low-level design, which deals with the physical aspects, including the specific devices to be used, cabling, and wiring considerations.
