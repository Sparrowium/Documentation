## Creating a Network Design

- [Juniper Network's Lifecycle Service]: Consist of three main phases and it's often cyclical throughout the design's lifetime.
	
	- [Planning Phase]: Assess the current environment and determine if it can satisfy the requirements proposed by the consumer. After evaluating the current setup, it will then move on to designing high-level architectural plans as well as low-level details of devices, configuration, and interconnection.
		
	- [Build Phase]: Deploying both test and production environments. Migrate from the existing environment to a new one, taking care of installations, configuration, system testing, and system enablement.
		
	- [Operate Phase]: Supporting the customer by making sure we have the most effective use of the solution and will provide assistance for any issues and faults, and carry out proactive maintenance. Optimize over time.
