## What is a Computer?

- A **computer** is an electronic device that can be programmed to carry out a set of instruction to manipulates information, or data. It has the ability to **store**, **retrieve**, and **process** data.

## Hardware vs Software

- [Hardware]: Is any part of your computer that has a **physical structure/appearance**.
	
- [Software]: Is any **set of instruction** that tells the hardware **what to do** and **how to do it**.

## What are the different types of computers?

- [Desktop Computer]: Is designed o be placed on a desk surface, and it is typically made up of few different parts.
	
- [Laptop Computer]: Is a battery-powered computer that is **more portable** than desktop, allowing you to use it everywhere.
	
- [Tablet Computer]: Is a handheld computer that are even more portable than laptop. Instead of using a **keyboard** and **mouse** like Laptop and Desktop, tablet use a **touch-sensitive screen** for typing and navigation.
	
- [Server]: Is a computer that serves up or transfer information to other computers on a network.
	
- [Specialized Computer]: Is a specialized type of computer that is designed to do a specific job. Ex: Smartphone, Wearable, Game Console, TV, etc.

## Basic Parts of a Computer

- [Computer Case]: 
	
	- A computer is a metal and plastic box that **contains the main components** of the computer, including the [Motherboard], [Central Processing Unit (CPU)], and [Power Supply Unit]. The front of the case usually has an I/O Interface Port that has an **On/Off button**. 
		
	- Computer cases comes in different shapes and sizes. A [Desktop Case] lies flat on a desk, and the monitor usually sits on top of it. A [Tower Case] is a tall and sits next to the monitor or on the floor. The [All-In-One] computers come with the internal components built into the monitor.
	
- [Monitor]: 
	
	- The monitor works with the **video/graphic card**, located inside the computer case, to display images and text on the screen. Most monitors have **control buttons** that allow you to change your monitor's settings, and some also have built-in speaker.
		
	- Monitor either have **LCD**(Liquid Crystal Display) or **LED**(Light-Emitting Diode) displays. These can be made very thin, and they are often called **flat panel displays**. Older monitors uses **CRT**(Cathode Ray Tube) displays.
	
- [Keyboard]: Is an **input interface/device** that allows you to communicate with the computer via typing letters.
	
- [Mouse]: 
	
	- Is a **pointing device**, it lets you **point** to objects on the screen, **click**(Input) on them, and **move** them.
		
	- [Trackball]: A form of mouse but instead uses a ball as a pointing device.
		
	- [Touchpad]: - also called a trackpad - Is a touch-sensitive pad that lets you control the pointer by making a drawing motion with your finger.

## Buttons and Ports on a Computer

- [Front of the Computer Case]: Usually have 1-3 USB port, 1-2 Aux port, Power button.
	
- [Back of the Computer Case]: Has **connection ports** that are made to fit **specific devices**. Usually have 2-5 USB port, 3 Video port (VGA, HDMI, DP), 6 Aux port, 1 RJ-45 Port, 1 Power supply port, some will have RP-SMA port/connector for external Wi-Fi antenna.
	
- [Peripherals to use with your Computer]: 
	
	- Basic computer setup usually includes computer case, monitor, keyboard, and mouse, but you can plug many different type of devices into the extra port on your computer. These devices are called peripherals.
		
	- [Printer]: A printer is used to print documents, photos, and anything else that appear on your screen on to a blank paper (Typically A4). There are many types of printers, including inkjet, laser, and photo printer. There are even all-in-one printer which can scan and print document.
		
	- [Scanner]: A scanner allows you to copy a physical image or document and save it to your computer as a digital (computer readable) image. 
		
	- [Speaker/Headphone]: Speakers and headphones are audio output devices. Depending on the model they may connect to either AUX port or USB port.
		
	- [Microphone]: A microphone is an audio input devices. Some have built-in microphone.
		
	- [Web Cameras]: A web camera-or a webcam-is a type of video input device that can record and take pictures. It can also transmit video over internet in **real time**, which allows for video chat or video conferencing with someone else. Some have integrated speaker/microphone.
		
	- Other devices may include [Game Controller], [Joystick], [Digital Cameras], and [Mobiles Devices].

## Inside a Computer

- [Motherboard]: The computer **main circuit board**. It's a thin PCB plate that holds the CPU, Memory, Connectors for Hard Drives and Optical Drives, Expansion Cards to control the Video and Audio, and connections to your computer's ports. The mother board connects directly or indirectly to every part of the computer.
	
- [CPU/Processor]: The central processing unit (CPU), also called the processor, is located inside the computer case on the motherboard. It is called the brain of the computer, and its job is to execute and carries out commands from user's input.
	
- [RAM (Random Access Memory)]: RAM is your computer's **short-term memory** which means that it is volatile. Whenever your computer performs executions, it temporarily stores the data in the RAM until it is needed. This short-term memory **disappears** when the computer is turned off. RAM is often measured in **Bytes** or **Binary-Byte(bibyte)**. And the more RAM you have the more memory your computer can access and use it to process because it is **easy to access**. 
	
- [Storage Drive]: The **storage drive** is where your software and documents are stored. These are non-volatile memory, means that the data will still be saved even if the machine is off. When you run a program, the computer copies some of the data from the storage devices onto the RAM. There are two main types of storage devices: HDD (Hard Disk Drive), and SSD (Solid State Drive).
	
- [Power Supply Unit]: The power supply unit in a computer **converts the power** from the wall outlet to the type of power needed by the computer. It sends power through cables to the motherboard.
	
- [Expansion Cards]: 
	
	- Most computers have expansions slots that are called **PCIE (Peripheral Component Interconnect Express)** that allows you to add various types of **expansion cards**.
		
	- [Video Card/Graphics Card]: The **video card** is responsible for **what you see** on the monitor. Some computers have a **GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)** built into the CPU/Processor.
		
	- [Sound Card]: The sound card-audio card-is responsible for what you hear in the speakers or headphones. Most computer have built-in sound card. 
		
	- [Network Card]: The network card allows your computer to communicate over a network and access internet. It can either be connected through **Ethernet** or **Wireless**. Most computers has built in network card.
