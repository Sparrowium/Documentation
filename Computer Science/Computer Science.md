## What is it?

- _Computer Science_ is the study of computers, computation, information and automation.
## What does it involves? or what is included with it?
- [[Theoretical disciplines]]: mathematical abstract in spirit, but it derives its motivation from practical and everyday computation. It aims to understand computation and, as a consequence of this understanding, provide more efficient methodologies.
	
- [[Applied disciplines]]: practical use of computer software and analysis tools to solve problems in other scientific fields.
	
- [[Computer Systems]]: a combination of hardware and software that can be programmed to perform a variety of tasks.
## What is the main point of Computer Science?

- To study and develop the theoretical foundations of practical application of computing systems.

## What are the Paradigms of Computer Science? 

- [_Functional programming_]: A style of building the structures and elements of computer programs that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids state and mutable data. It is declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions or declarations instead of statements.
	
- [_Imperative programming_]: A programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state. In much the same way that imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform. Imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates. 
	
- [Object-Oriented programming]: A programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which may contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods. A feature of objects is that an object's procedures can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated. Thus object-oriented computer programs are made out of objects that interact with one another.
	
- [Declarative programming]: A non-imperative style of programming in which programs describes their desired results without explicitly listing commands or steps that must be performed. Functional and logic programming languages are characterized by a declarative programming style. In logic programming, programs consists of sentences expressed in logical form, and computation uses those sentences to solve problems, which are also expressed in logical form.
	
- [Service-Oriented programming]: A programming paradigm that uses "services" as the unit of computer work, to design and implement integrated business applications and mission critical software programs.
	
- [Procedural programming]: A programming paradigm, classified as imperative programming, that involves implementing the behavior of a computer program as procedures that call each other. The resulting program is a series of steps that forms a hierarchy of calls to its constituent procedures.
