## What is a Programming Language?

- A programming language is a set of instruction that enables humans to communicate with computers-using a series of symbols that serve as a bridge that allows humans to turn ideas into instructions computers can understand.

## How are they described?

- Programming Languages are described in terms of their [[#syntax]] (form) and [[#semantics]] (meaning), usually defined by a formal language.
	
- Languages are also describe by their feature such as a [[#type system]], [[#variables]], and mechanisms for [[#error handling]].

## Why is it important?

- An implementation of a programming language is required in order to execute programs, namely an interpreter or a compiler.

## Programming Languages Elements

### Syntax

- The syntax of a programming/computer language is the rules that define the combinations of symbols that are considered to be correctly structured statements or expressions in that language.
	
- The syntax of language defines its surface form. *Text-based* computer languages are based on sequences of characters, while *Visual* programming languages are based on the spatial layout and connections between symbols.
	
- [Levels of Syntax]:
	
	- Words: The lexical level, determining how characters form tokens.
		
	- Phrases: The grammar level, narrowly speaking, determining how tokens form phrases.
		
	- Context: Determining what objects or variables names refer to, if types are valid.
	
- [Syntax Error]: An error in the *syntax* of a sequence of characters that is intended to be written in a particular *programming language*.
	
	- For compiled languages, syntax errors are detected at compile-time.
		
	- For interpreted languages, syntax error are detect during program execution.

### Semantics

- The meaning of the languages

### Type Systems

- A type system is a logical system comprising a set of rules that assigns a property called a type to every single term.

### Programming Language Levels

- High-Level Languages: Most user friendly, with a syntax closer to human language
