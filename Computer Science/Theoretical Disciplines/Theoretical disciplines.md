## Basic

Theoretical Computer Science is mathematical and abstract in spirit, but it derives its motivation from practical and everyday computation. It aims to understand the natures of computation and, as a consequence of this understanding provide more methodologies.
### Sub-Fields and Topics

- [[Algorithms]]: An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for calculations. Algorithms are used for calculation, data processing, and automated reasoning. It is an effective method expressed as a finite list of well-defined instructions for calculating a function.
	
- [[Automate Theory]]: The study of abstract machines and automata, as well as the computational problems that can be solved using them. It is a theory in theoretical computer science, under discrete mathematics. *Automata* comes from the Greek word meaning "self-acting". It is also the study of self-operating virtual machines to help in the logical understanding of input and output process, without or with intermediate stage(s) of computation.
	
- [[Coding Theory]]: The study of the properties of codes and their fitness for a specific application.
	
- [[Computational Complexity Theory]]: A branch of the theory of computation that focuses on classifying computational problems according to their inherent difficulty, and relating those classes to each other. A computational problem is understood to be a task that is in principle amenable to being solved by a computer, which is equivalent to stating that the problem may be solved by a mechanical application of mathematical steps, such as algorithms.
	
- [[Computational Geometry]]: A branch of computer science devoted to the study of algorithms that can be stated in terms of geometry. Some purely geometrical problems arise out of the study of computational geometric algorithms, and such problems are also considered to be part of computational geometry. The main impetus for the development of computational geometry as a discipline was progress in computer graphics and computer-aided design and manufacturing, but many problems in computational geometry are classical in nature, and may come from mathematical visualization
	
- [[Computational Learning Theory]]: Theoretical results in machine learning mainly deal with a type of inductive learning called supervised learning. In supervised learning, an algorithm is given samples that are labeled in some useful way. The goal of the supervised learning algorithm is to optimize some measure of performance such as minimizing the number of mistakes made on new samples. 
	
- [[Computational Number Theory]]: The study of algorithms for performing number theoretic computations. The best known problem in the field is integer factorization.
	
- [[Cryptography]]: Practice and study for techniques for secure communications in the presence of third parties.
	
- [[Data Structures]]: A particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently 
	
- [[Distributed Computation]]: Studies distributed systems. A distributed system is a software system in which components located on networked computers communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages. The components interact with each other in order to achieve a common goal. Three significant characteristics of distributed systems are: concurrency of components, lack of a global clock, and independent failure of components.
	
- [[Information-based Complexity]]: Studies optimal algorithms and computational complexity for continuous problems.
	
- [[Formal Methods]]: Are particular kind of mathematics based techniques for the specification, development and verification of software and hardware system. The use of formal methods for software and hardware design is motivated by the expectation that, as in other engineering disciplines, performing appropriate mathematical analysis can contribute to the reliability and robustness of a design.
	
- [[Information Theory]]: A branch of applied mathematics, electrical engineering, and computer science involving the quantification of information.
	
- [[Machine Learning]]: A scientific discipline that deals with the construction and study of algorithms that can learn from data. Such algorithms operate by building a model based on inputs and using that to make predictions or decisions, rather than following explicitly programmed instructions.
	
- [[Natural Computation]]: Also called natural computation, is a terminology introduced to encompass three classes of methods: 1) those that take inspiration from nature for the development of novel problem-solving techniques; 2) those that are based on the use of computers to synthesize natural phenomena; and 3) those that employ natural materials (e.g., molecules) to compute.
	
- [[Parallel Computation]]: Parallel computing is a form of computation in which many calculations are carried out simultaneously, operating on the principle that large problems can often be divided into smaller ones, which are then solved "in parallel". There are several different forms of parallel computing: bit-level, instruction level, data, and task parallelism. Parallelism has been employed for many years, mainly in high-performance computing, but interest in it has grown lately due to the physical constraints preventing frequency scaling. As power consumption (and consequently heat generation) by computers has become a concern in recent years, parallel computing has become the dominant paradigm in computer architecture, mainly in the form of multi-core processors.
	
- [[Programming Language Theory and Program Semantics]]: A branch of computer science that deals with the design, implementation, analysis, characterization, and classification of programming languages and their individuals feature. 
	
- [[Quantum Computation]]: A quantum computer is a computation system that makes direct use of quantum-mechanical phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform operations on data. Quantum computers are different from digital computers based on transistors. Whereas digital computers require data to be encoded into binary digits (bits), each of which is always in one of two definite states (0 or 1), quantum computation uses qubits (quantum bits), which can be in superpositions of states. A theoretical model is the quantum Turing machine, also known as the universal quantum computer. Quantum computers share theoretical similarities with non-deterministic and probabilistic computers; one example is the ability to be in more than one state simultaneously.
	
- [[Symbolic Computation]]: A scientific area that refers to the study and development of algorithms and software for manipulating mathematical expressions and other mathematical objects.
	
- [[Very-Large-Scale Integration]]: The process of creating an integrated circuit (IC) by combining thousands of transistors into a single chip.
