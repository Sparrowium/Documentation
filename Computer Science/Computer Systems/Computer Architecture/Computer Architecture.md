## Inside Common Devices

- [Desktop PC]: 
	
	
	- Contains the mainboard/motherboard, which contains the essential parts of the computer including the Processor and main Memory. 
		
	- The mainboard aka **Printed Circuit Board** started off with an acid-proof fiberglass insulator board, completely covered with a layer of copper, then design the board in a CAD program, print it onto transparency, and shine light through transparency to selectively mask a light sensitive chemical on the board. After that, dip it into acid to remove the unmasked copper and the rest of the copper will become the wiring. You then solder the electronic components onto the appropriate location on the board. 
		
	- Beyond that, the rest of the Desktop components are power transformers (PSU), Cooler, and Storage devices.
	
- [Laptop]:
	
	- Same as the PCs, but they use smaller, less power consuming components with less computing power and higher manufacturing cost.
		
	- The motherboard is shaped to fit the available space with many components soldered directly together to fit under the keyboard.
		
	- Some laptop have secure boot which prevent customization regarding to the Operating System.
	
- [Smartphone]:  
	
	- The word "smart" mean *is a computer*. The smartphone motherboard design is based around the CPU, including with other chips that are specialized for phone-specific roles. Th
		
	- The memory is different from laptop since it uses LPDDR (Low Power Ram). This reduces battery usages by clearing and turning off unused parts.
		
	- Most connectors are limited due to the phone size.
	
- [Washing Machine]: 
	
	- Contains proprietary circuit boards that are design to run arbitrary programs. These circuit boards contains *firmware*, a single program "burned" into the chip that performs only one task.

## Historical Architectures

### What is a Computer?

- A computer is a machine that can simulate any other machine, given as mush memory it asks for.
	`Read, Write, and Process Data`
	`Read, Write, and Execute Program
	`Add (And do other arithmetic)`
	`Jump (goto statements`
	`Branch (if statements`

### Before the Industrial Revolution

- [The Stone Age]:
	
	- [Lebombo Bone]: A bone with carved notches that may have been used as a tally stick around 40000 BCE, in a tally, one marks represents one physical thing. An example of Data Representation.
		
	- [Ishango Bone]: A bone containing marks that appeared to be grouped into tally-like clusters of mostly prime number betweens 3-19, and these clusters are grouped into three lines that sum to 60 or 48. AN example of Advanced Calculation.
	
- [The Bronze Age]:
	
	- [Abacus]: A "sandbox" which implement the accumulator architecture, where the first number is loaded onto the device and the second is added to it, leaving only the final result as the state of the system.
	
- [The Iron Age]: 
	
	- [Antikythera Mechanism]: A odometers devices that were used to survey the maps.
	
- [The Islamic Golden Age]:
	
	- [The automatic flute player of Baghadad]: Uses rotating barrels with movable pins around its edge to indicate the positions of musical notes. The movable nature of pins allows different compositions to be programmed into the device, making it the first known *programmable* automatic machine.
	
- [The Renaissance and Enlightment]:
	
	- [Codex Madrid]: Contains an unbuilt design for a mechanical analog calculator based on Antikythera-like principle.
		
	- [Pascal Calculator]: Includes a digital mechanism similar to the odometer to implementing carry mechanism in mathematics.
	
- [The Steam Age]: 
	
	- [The Jacquard Loom]
		
	- [Victorian Barrel Organs with Music Boxes]
		
	- [Babbage's Difference Machine]
		
	- [Babbage's Analytics Machine]
	
- [The Diesel Age]: 
	
	- [IBM Hollerith Tabulating Machine]: A machine to automate data processing and big data analytics on information.
		
	- [Electromechanical Differential Analyzers]: Used to solve differential equations.
		
	- [Electromechanical Machines of WW2]: Mostly for crytography.
		
	- [The Zuse Z3]: The Z3 was an electromechanical machine using 2,000 electromechanical relay switches and a mechanical binary memory with 64 addresses of 22 bits. It could run up to 10 instructions per second
	
- [The Electrical Age]: 
	
	- [Vacuum Tubes]: An efficient replacement for relays.
		
	- [Eniac]: Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer.
		
	- [The Manchester Baby]: Electronic Stored-Program Computer.
	
- [The Transistor Age]:
	
	- [Transistor]: Performs the same function as a vacuum tube, but it's smaller, faster, and cheaper, and consume less power and more reliable.
		
	- [Integrated Circuit]
	
- [The Golden Age]: The age of computer architecture.
	
- [The 2000s and Reconnecting the Community]: Linux becomes popular and becoming the open platform for various engineers to develop on.
	
- [The 2010s and the End of Moore's Law]: Clock speed maxed out due to power consumption which leads to overheating, but new innovation burst and become a hit.
	
	- [Multicore Processor]
		
	- [Cluster Computing]
		
	- [The Evolution of Graphics Cards]
	
- [The 2020s, the Cloud, and the Internet of Things]: Where everything becomes data centered
