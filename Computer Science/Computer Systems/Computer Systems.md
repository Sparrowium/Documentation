## Basic

Computer Systems is a fields of studies that focuses on the understanding how different components of a computer system interact, including their architecture, design, performance, and how to optimize their functionality to solve computational problem effectively.

### Sub-Fields and Topics

- [[Computer Architecture]]: Is a description of the structure of a computer system made from component parts. It can sometimes be a high-level description that ignores details of the implementation. At a more detailed level, the description may include the instruction set architecture design, microarchitecture design, logic design, and implementation.
	
- [[Microarchitecture]]: Also called *computer organization* and sometimes abbreviated as Î¼arch or uarch, is the way a given instruction set architecture (ISA) is implemented in a particular processor. A given ISA may be implemented with different microarchitectures; implementations may vary due to different goals of a given design or due to shifts in technology.
	
- [[Concurrency]]: Refers to the ability of a system to execute multiple tasks through simultaneous execution or time-sharing (context switching), sharing resources and managing interactions. Concurrency improves responsiveness, throughput, and scalability in modern computing.
	
- [[Distributed Computing]]: A field of computer science that studies distributed systems, defined as computer systems whose inter-communicating components are located on different networked computers.
	
- [[Computer Networks]]: A set of computers sharing resources located on or provided by network nodes. It aims to manage networks between computers worldwide.
	
- [[System Software]]: Is software designed to provide a platform for other software.
	
- [[Database]]: Is intended to organize, store, and retrieve large amounts of data easily. Digital databases are managed using database management systems to store, create, maintain, and search data, through database models and query languages.
	
- [[Data Mining]]: A process of discovering patterns in large data sets.
