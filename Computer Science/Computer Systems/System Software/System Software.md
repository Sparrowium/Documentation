System software refers to the low-level software that manages and controls a computer's hardware and provide basic services to higher-level software.

## What is System Software?

- System software is a software that provides **platform** for other software.
	
- It also consists of programs written in low-level languages, used to interact with the hardware at a very basic level.
	
- System Software serves as the interface between the hardware and the end users. 
	
- Systems software refers to the collection of programs and software components that enable a computer or computing device to function properly.
	
- It acts as an intermediary between the user and the computer hardware, allowing the user to interact with the hardware and use various applications and programs.

## Examples of System Software

- [[Operating System]]: Windows, [[Linux]], MacOS,...
	
- [Device Drivers]: Software that enables the communication between the hardware and OS.
	
- [Firmware]: Pre-installed low-level software that controls a device's basic functions.
	
- [Utility Software]: Tools for system maintenance and optimization.
	
- [Boot Loaders]: Software that initializes the OS during startup.

## System Software Applications

- [Hardware Communication]: Serves as an interface between the hardware and software components of a computer, enabling them to communicate and work together.
	
- [Resource Management]: Manages computer resources such as memory, CPU usage, and storage, optimizing their utilization and ensuring that the system operates efficiently.
	
- [Security]: Provides security measures such as firewalls, antivirus software, and encryption, protecting the system and its data from malware, virus, and other security cheats.
	
- [User Interface]: Provides a user interface that allows users to interact with the computer or computing device and perform various tasks.
	
- [Application Support]: Supports the installation and running of applications and software on the system.
	
- [Customization]: Allows for customization of the system settings and configuration, giving the users greater control over their computing environment.

## System Software Features

- [Memory Management]: Operating System perform memory management. The OS keeps track of the primary memory and allocates the memory when a process requests it.
	
- [Process Management]: OS performs process management. Allocates the main memory (RAM) to a process and de-allocates it when it is no longer required.
	
- [File-Management]: OS perform file management. Allocates and de-allocates the resources and decides who gets the resources.
	
- [Security]: Prevents unauthorized access to programs and data using passwords.
	
- [Error-Detecting Aids]: Production of dumps, traces, error messages, and other debugging and error-detecting methods.
	
- [Scheduling]: The OS schedules the process through its scheduling algo.

## Issues in System Software

- [Compatibility Issues]: System software may not be compatible with certain hardware components, which can cause errors or crashes.
	
- [Security Issues]: System software may contain vulnerabilities that can be exploited by hackers or malware to gain unauthorized access to the system or steal sensitive data.
	
- [Performance Issues]: System software may not be optimized for the hardware or may be resource-intensive, which can cause the system to slow down or freeze.
	
- [Update Issues]: System software updates may contain bugs or compatibility issues that can cause problems with the system or other software components.
	
- [Licensing Issues]: Some system software may require licensing or activation, which can cause problems if the license expires or if there are licensing errors.
	
- [User Interface Issues]: The user interface of system software may not be intuitive or may be difficult to use, which can affect the user experience.
