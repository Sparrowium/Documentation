## What is Artificial Intelligence?

- It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. Such machines may be called AIs.
	
- AI is a/an improvement/derived/advance of Neural Network.
	
- A specific focus of AI is called an LLM (Large Learning Model).
