A field within Computer Science and a branch of Engineering focused on designing, developing, testing, and maintaining of software applications. 

## What is Software Engineering?

- Software Engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software. It is a systematic and disciplined approach to software development that aims to create high-quality, reliable, and maintainable software.

## Key Principles of Software Engineering

- [Modularity]: Breaking the software into smaller, reusable components that can be developed and tested independently.
	
- [Abstraction]: Hiding the implementation details of a component and exposing only the necessary functionality to other parts of the software.
	
- [Encapsulation]: Wrapping up data and functions of an object into a single unit, and protecting the internal state of an object from external modifications.
	
- [Reusability]: Creating components that can be used to multiple projects, which can save time and resources.
	
- [Maintenance]: Regularly updating and improving the software to fix bugs, add new features, and address security vulnerabilities.
	
- [Testing]: Verifying that the software meets its requirements and is free of bugs.
	
- [Design Patterns]: Solving recurring problems in software design by providing templates for solving them.
	
- [Agile Methodologies]: Using iterative and incremental development processes that focus on customer satisfaction, rapid delivery, and flexibility.
	
- [Continuous Integration and Deployment]: Continuously integrating the code changes and deploying them into production environment.
