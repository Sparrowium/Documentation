A field within Computer Science and a branch of Engineering focused on designing, developing, testing, and maintaining of software applications. 

## What is Software Engineering?

- Software Engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software. It is a systematic and disciplined approach to software development that aims to create high-quality, reliable, and maintainable software.

## Workload

- [Requirement Analysis]: Is about elicitation, analysis, specification, and validation of requirements for software. Software requirements can be functional, non-functional, or domain. 
	
	- [Functional Requirements]: Describe expected behaviors (outputs).
		
	- [Non-functional Requirements]: Specify issues like portability, security, maintainability, reliability, scalability, performance, reusability, and flexibility.
		
	- Classification: Interface constraint, performance constraint, life cycle constraint, and economic constraint.
		
	- [Domain Requirements]: The characteristic of a certain category or domain of projects.
	
- [Software Design]: The process of making high-level plans for the software. Design is sometimes divided into levels: 
	
	- [Interface Design]: Plans the interaction between a system and its environment as well as the inner working of the system.
		
	- [Architectural Design]: Plans the major components of a system, including their responsibilities, properties, and interfaces between them. 
		
	- [Detailed Design]: Plans internal elements, including their properties, relationships, algorithms and data structures.
	
- [Software Construction]: Involves programming, unit testing, integration testing, and debugging so as to implement the design.
	
- [Software Testing]: Is an empirical, technical investigation conducted to provide stakeholders with information about the quality of the software under test.
	
- [Program Analysis]: Is the process of analyzing computer programs with respect to an aspect such as performance, robustness, and security.
